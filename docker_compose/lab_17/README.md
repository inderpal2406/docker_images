## Lab 17

## `scale` command
The `docker-compose scale <service name> = <no of instances>` sets the number of containers to run for a service.

**NOTE:** The scale command is deprecated, instead Use the up command with the â€“scale flag. <br>
`docker-compose up --scale <service name> = <no of instances>`

**NOTE:** The `docker-compose.yml` file in this directory is invalid as there is no specification named `instances` in docker-compose.yml terminology.

Remaining to be practised.
