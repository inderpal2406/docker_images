## `start` command
* The `docker-compose start` command helps us to start containers of a service.
* If, we stop any daemonized container using `docker-compose stop <service name>` and then restart it using `docker-compose start <service name>`, then docker-compose will start the container in daemonized form only with the properties that existed and no changes.
* How `docker-compose up` and `docker-compose start` are different? But both have their specific uses.
